iubenda take home challenge
We’re really happy to invite you to complete the next stage of the engineering interview process.
What we’d like you to do
Instead of building something dull and unrelated to what we do here in iubenda let’s create a simplified version of iubenda T&C Generator.
The T&C generator is software which given:
- A template
- A dataset
Transforms the template into a Document expanding the template tags into their rappresentation using the dataset. Below you can find more details.
Template
Is a text made of: - Plaintext
- Tags
TAGS
The tags supported are:
Clauses: [CLAUSE-#{ID}]
Sections: A group of clauses, represented with [SECTION-#{ID}]
Example
Given the following template:
And the following dataset:
clauses:
sections:
Creates the following T&C document:
Non fuctional requirements
As well as the functional requirements we also want your solution to:
Be written in ruby
Have tests
Include a Readme.md (think of it like the description you write on a github PR) which outlines:
how to setup and run the application/automated tests
design decisions
how much time you took and what you would have done given more time.
The bulk of our score comes from how you completed these functional and non-functional requirements. We also evaluate:
- How idiomatic your ruby code is
- Good quality tests
- Good names of classes and methods
- Not over-engineering
- The OO design of your classes and methods - Meaningful commits
- Not spending way too long on it
We are not monsters: UI and Rails are not required, just focus on the requirements.
We expect you to spend a time range between 4 to 6 hours for completing this challenge.
Use all the tools you need to ensure quality up to your standards. When done please send us the work via email (zipped .git repository).
