# iubenda take home challenge

We’re really happy to invite you to complete the next stage of the engineering interview process.
What we’d like you to do
Instead of building something dull and unrelated to what we do here in iubenda let’s create a simplified version of iubenda T&C Generator.

The T&C generator is software which given:

- A template

- A dataset

Transforms the template into a Document expanding the template tags into their representation using the dataset. Below you can find more details.

### Template

Is a text made of:

- Plain text

- Tags


### TAGS

The tags supported are:

- Clauses: <b>[CLAUSE-#{ID}]</b>

- Sections: A group of clauses, represented with <b>[SECTION-#{ID}]</b>

### Example

Given the following template:

    A T&C Document

    This document is made of plaintext.
    Is made of [CLAUSE-3].
    Is made of [CLAUSE-4].
    Is made of [SECTION-1].
    Your legals.


And the following dataset:

clauses:


     [
      { "id": 1, "text": 'The quick brown fox' },
      { "id": 2, "text": 'jumps over the lazy dog' },
      { "id": 3, "text": 'And dies' },
      { "id": 4, "text": 'The white horse is white' }
     ]


sections:

    [
      { "id": 1, "clauses_ids": [1, 2] }
    ]


Creates the following T&C document:

    A T&C Document

    This document is made of plaintext.
    Is made of And dies.
    Is made of The white horse is white.
    Is made of The quick brown fox;jumps over the lazy dog.
    Your legals.

## Non fuctional requirements

As well as the functional requirements we also want your solution to:

- Be written in ruby

- Have tests

- Include a Readme.md (think of it like the description you write on a github PR) which outlines:

- how to setup and run the application/automated tests

- design decisions

- how much time you took and what you would have done given more time.

The bulk of our score comes from how you completed these functional and non-functional requirements. We also evaluate:

- How idiomatic your ruby code is

- Good quality tests

- Good names of classes and methods

- Not over-engineering

- The OO design of your classes and methods - Meaningful commits

- Not spending way too long on it

## local setup

1. `cd` to the source code.

2. Run `bundle` to install gems from Gemfile.

3. Read the docs `yard server -r -d && open -a "Google Chrome" http://0.0.0.0:8808`

4. Run specs with `rake` command.

5. Use it well!
